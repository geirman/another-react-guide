## Motivation
There are already tons of guides and articles about React, but as they are also sometimes outdated, I want to try to build a curated (and partially opinionated) set of React "best practices", tips and more.

This guide is not about how to get started with React, it is more about how you can get the most out of it while learning new things to build awesome applications effectively and efficiently with React.

There might be some things that you personally don't agree with or think is (totally) wrong. If you see the latter, please don't set this guide on fire. Instead contribute to it, so we learn together and get to know what would be correct. When something is outdated, feel free to contribute as well.

I know that there is still (a lot of) content missing, but keep an eye on this guide as I will (try) to fill it up as good as I can. Therefore feedback and contributions are heartly welcome to make this guide great!

## Basics
#### Use JSX Syntax & ES2015/ES6
If you are not using [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) in your React components, you should consider to do it along with writing your code in ES2015/ES6 and transpile it with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). Babel allows you to "use next generation Javascript, today", so your code is also future-proof. An introduction to ES6 and a list of features can be found [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/). This document is based on ES6+ and assumes that you are already familiar with ES6.

## Components
### Use Classes and Stateless Functions
#### Classes
When using ES6, you should also create your components as classes with `class extends React.Component` instead of ES5 `React.createClass` (unless you need mixins, but this should be a rare case and you have very godo reason to do so).

**Example:** [(Open in JS Bin)](http://jsbin.com/vimate/edit?js,output)
```jsx
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)

    this.state = {
      count: 0
    }
    
    this.increment = this.increment.bind(this)
  }

  increment() {
    this.setState({
      count: this.state.count + 1
    })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>
          Counter: {this.state.count}
        </h1>
        <button onClick={this.increment}>
          {this.props.buttonText}
        </button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

#### Stateless Functions
Components can also be defined as plain JavaScript functions (Stateless Function). They will benefit from future React performance optimizations.

**Important:** Stateless functions should be written as [normal functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions) instead of [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), because they are anonymous functions and don't have a `name` property.

You should use stateless functions when your component
- has no `state`.
- has no `refs`.
- doesn't need a `constructor`.
- doesn't access `context`.

**Example:** [(Open in JS Bin)](http://jsbin.com/yofevi/edit?js,output)
```jsx
function Button({text, onClick}) {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick}>
      {text}
    </button>
  )
}
```

### Use Property Validation
Make sure that components are used correctly by specifying `propTypes`. They are validating the data that the component is receiving and throws an error in the console when an invalid property has been provided which is really helpful during development. React has [different validators](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#prop-validation) that you should use, but you can also write your own one. Note that the validation is only active in development builds.

**Example:** [(Open in JS Bin)](http://jsbin.com/setiyo/edit?js,console,output)
```jsx
function Headline({text}) {
  return <h1>{text}</h1>
}

Headline.propTypes = {
  text: React.PropTypes.string.isRequired
}

function App() {
  // This will throw:
  // "Warning: Failed propType: Invalid prop `text` of type `number` 
  // supplied to `Headline`, expected `string`. Check the 
  // render method of `App`."
  return <Headline text={123} />
}
```

### `bind` methods in `constructor`
A `bind` call in `render` creates a new function on every single render. Instead `bind` methods in the `constructor`.

**Example:**
```jsx
// Bad
class Foo extends React.Component {
  doSomething() {
    // Do something
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.doSomething.bind(this)}>
        Do something
      </button>
    )
  }
}

// Good
class Foo extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    
    this.doSomething = this.doSomething.bind(this)
  }
  doSomething() {
    // Do something
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.doSomething}>
        Do something
      </button>
    )
  }
}
```

### Use `componentDidMount` for async actions
When dealing with asynchronous actions like `setTimeout` or AJAX requests, do it in [`componentDidMount`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html#mounting-componentdidmount) (client only) and not in [`componentWillMount`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html#mounting-componentwillmount) (client & serverside) to prevent issues/side effects.

### JSX
#### Adding whitespace in texts before line break with `{' '}`
Instead of dealing with `&nbsp;`, you can also write `{' '}` to add a whitespace before a line break in texts.

**Example:** [(Open in JS Bin)](http://jsbin.com/wokugo/edit?js,output)
```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      // Bad
      <p>
        An ugly HTML entity before&nbsp;
        <i>me.</i>
      </p>
      
      // Good
      <p>
        Look at{' '}
        <i>me!</i>
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### ES7 Features
#### Use Arrow Functions in Classes
Instead of needing to `bind` your methods to `this`, ES7 property initializers ([stage 0 preset](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-stage-0/)) allows us to use arrow functions (ES6), so we can omit the extra binding in `constructor`.

**Example:** [(Open in JS Bin)](http://jsbin.com/tajaqo/edit?js,output)
```jsx
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)

    this.state = {
      count: 0
    }
  }

  increment = () => {
    this.setState({
      count: this.state.count + 1
    })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>
          Counter: {this.state.count}
        </h1>
        <button onClick={this.increment}>
          {this.props.buttonText}
        </button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

## AJAX

## Data Handling

## Performance Optimizations
React is already very performant out of the box and the following performance tips are optional and not needed when you have a small application. Performance can be an issue when your application is at some point very big and you have hundreds of components for example.

### Use `shouldComponentUpdate` to avoid unnecessary re-renderings
By default [`shouldComponentUpdate`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html#updating-shouldcomponentupdate) returns always `true` and re-renders the component when it receives new `props` or `state`. You can avoid that by returning `true` on only necessary `props` or `state` changes.

**Example:**
```jsx
shouldcomponentUpdate(nextProps) {
  nextProps.foo !== this.props.foo
}
```

This example above works for simple equality checks like `strings` or `numbers`. But if your `props` or `state` are `objects` or `arrays`, the reference will be compared and not the content. Therefore we need a deep comparison. React provides a helper function [`shallowCompare`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/shallow-compare.html) for this via npm [`react-addons-shallow-compare`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-addons-shallow-compare).

**Example**:
```jsx
import shallowCompare from 'react-addons-shallow-compare'

...

  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    return shallowCompare(this, nextProps, nextState)
  }

...
```
